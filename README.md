BlockChainv01
BlockChainv01 is a project aimed at integrating blockchain technology with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and secure data storage. This project serves as a foundational step towards building a robust blockchain-based application.

Features
Blockchain Implementation: Implements a basic blockchain structure with blocks containing data, timestamps, and hash values.
IPFS Integration: Utilizes IPFS for decentralized storage of data associated with blockchain transactions.
API Endpoints: Provides RESTful API endpoints for adding data to IPFS and retrieving data from IPFS.
Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
.NET SDK 
IPFS node running locally or accessible via API
